 *         Satellites are bodies that float around each other pulling at each
 *         other with gravity. The mass of an object determines how much
 *         gravitational force it applies to others.
 * 
 *
 *         Most of the methods below are labeled ABSTRACT... It is up to you to
 *         keep this labeling (and thus implement the functions in the children
 *         classes), or to remove the abstract label and implement the method
 *         for EVERY child, or two implement it here, but override it in
 *         specific children classes
 * 
 *         At the same time you are writing this class, you should consider
 *         writing specific children classes such as Planet, Star, or Flotsam.
 *         Also feel free to add comets, saucer, etc., but don't do so until the
 *         main program is itself working.
 *
 *         Finally, if you haven't implemented and testing your Geometry Vector
 *         code, any changes here will be in vain, as all math should use it.

	/**
	 * Function Purpose:
	 * 
	 * Change position of this object by adding this object's velocity to this
	 * object's position.
	 * 
	 * Math Example: our position is 1,1. The move vector is 10,10. Our new
	 * position is 11,11
	 *
	 *
	 * Abstract Method Choice: for this function, and many below, you must
	 * choose whether to implement it here or in all child classes. In this
	 * case:
	 * 
	 * 1) is "moving" the same regardless of type. Do stars and planets "move"
	 * through space the same. (Hint, I would expect that they do). If the
	 * answer is that all satellites move the same, then remove the "Abstract"
	 * label and implement the code here.
	 * 
	 * 2) if what it means to move is different based on the type of object
	 * (this would be true in a video game) then you would leave this as an
	 * abstract method and only implement it in the child classes.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @param dt
	 *            a small number representing how much time has gone by
	 * 
	 *            Note: we are using discrete math work in a continuous system.
	 *            This means that in the real world time is constantly flowing.
	 *            In a simluation time is broken into a stream of continuous
	 *            tiny time blocks.
	 * 
	 *            To make the simulation work we must scale by a time factor.
	 *            What this means can be shown by looking at a car that is
	 *            moving at 50 miles per hour down the highway. If we took the
	 *            car's current position and velocity and drew a line 50 miles
	 *            forward, we could try and say that is where the car would be
	 *            in an hour. In reality, that would be wrong (no doubt the
	 *            highway would change directions (at least a little) long
	 *            before that)).
	 * 
	 *            What we can do is take the car that is moving at 50 miles per
	 *            hour and compute how far it will go in, say, 1 second. Move it
	 *            forward that much, then recompute. If we do this 60*60 times
	 *            we will have a better approximation of where the car would be
	 *            in reality.
	 *
	 *            Note: the parameter dt represents the fraction of the velocity
	 *            that will be applied at a given instant.
	 * 
	 *            Math Example: Our current position is 5,5. Our current
	 *            velocity is 100,100. The time step is 0.05; Our new position
	 *            would be 10,10 -> 5,5 + (100,100 * .05)
	 * 
	 *            WARNING: even if not explicitly stated in other parts of this
	 *            documentation, all of the math should be done via the Vector
	 *            library.
	 * 
	 *            WARNING 2: This code does not change anything about the GUI
	 *            display of the object

	 * 
	 *            if my velocity is 100,0 and I am told to accelerate by 200,100
	 *            (in say one tenth of a second) we only apply one tenth of the
	 *            200,100, so the answer would be 100,0 + (200,100)/10 -->
	 *            120,10
	 *

	 * at 300,300
	 * 
	 * In this method, transform the current objects position from WORLD
	 * coordinates into GUI coordinates x,y.

	 * In order to do this we have to know our relation to the center of the

	 * 
	 * Note: The first thing to in an update_screen_coordinates method would be
	 * to update the display size of the object. the last thing you would do is
	 * set the location of the object.
	 * 
	 * Abstract Method Choice: Once again, if you believe the math to transform
	 * from one x,y to another is different for different objects, then you
	 * should leave this method abstract and let each child class implement it.
	 * 
	 * If you believe the math is the same for all objects, you should remove
	 * the "abstract" keyword and write the code here.
	 * 
	 * Math: to start try the following: divide the simluation X,Y by say
	 * 1,000,000. This should transform the positions into something reasonable,
	 * (e.g., the earth becomes 149,0) Then simply use this vale.
	 * 
	 * The planets (assuming everything else is correct) will now rotate around
	 * the 0,0 location of the GUI (the upper left hand corner). By then adding
	 * half the width of the screen/height of the screen to this number (hard
	 * code to say 500,500) the planets will rotate around 500, 500.
