Homework X - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Lisa Richardson
Date:    Jan 26, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 8 hours

Partner Score: # - My parter did amazing! She was very diligent and tried her best to find solutions
to all of the problems that we faced. If she did not know the answer then she was very diligent and
was good at asking the TA's inspired questions in the CADE lab. She understood the code a lot more 
than I did so she was nice enough to try and explain it to me. It helped me learn a lot more than
I would have had I been
working alone on this project.

Group Analysis:  

Our group worked out well because we were able to bounce ideas off of each other. I believe that
were able to get more accomplished on this assignment because two brains are better than one. I feel
like we both attributed equally on this assignment.
