Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #4 - My parter was the best partner that I have had so far. She knew what she was doing, but 
					when she didn't, she would ask me for suggestions. None of my other partners did that. 
					She also aloud me to take control of the computer more than any of my other partners. 
					She worked extremely hard on this assignment whenever we could get together. 

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership was incredible. We worked together on finding a solution to
				our problems. We debuged our code together extremely well. We were able to find the bugs
				very quick and efficiently. We worked together as a team more than any of my other partners.
