Assignment #11 - Heaps

The Heaps Project Summary:

In assignment eleven, we were to build a heap using an array.

Design Decisions: Followed the instructions given to the best of our ability.

Problems Encountered and Their Solutions: Had a hard time with implementing each of the methods. We ran into a few issues
										  when running our tests. Thankfully, we were able to fix those bugs using the 
										  debugger. The largest problem that we faced in my opinion was the bubble down method.
