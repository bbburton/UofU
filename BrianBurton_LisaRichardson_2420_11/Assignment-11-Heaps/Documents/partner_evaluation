My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Lisa Richardson
Date:    April 14, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 10 hours.

Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #3 - My parter was great once again. She was very willing to work with me and my schedule that was less 
					than ideal this week. She was also able to catch a few mistakes that I tried to make. She also 
					once again gave me very good insight on how to be an effective programmer. 

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership was better than usual. We were better able to level out the work load. 
				That is a big thanks to my brain that is finally maybe catching up to the level of intellect that it 
				should be at for this class. I was better able to understand and code during this assignment than usual.
				It sounds bad but I believe it to be true.
