My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Lisa Richardson
Date:    Feb 02, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 16 hours

1. Partner did very little.
2. Partner did less work than I did.
3. Partner did an equal value of work as I did.
4. Partner did more work than I did.
5. Partner did almost all the work.

Partner Score: #4 - My parter did amazing as usual. She is very smart and a hard worker. She understands programming way more
					than I do. She understands the problem and is usually able to find a solution. She is very patient with
					me even though I am not at her level of expertise. She is also willing to work with my crazy schedule.

Group Analysis: I feel that we did the best that we could possibly do with the circumstances that we had. We worked as often
				as we could together, listened to each others ideas, and traded off using the computer. We were able to work
				through the problems that we faced by talking through them and trial and error. Over all I am very happy with
				our effort and the successes that we were able to have.
