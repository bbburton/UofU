My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Lisa Richardson
Date:    April 25, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 18 hours.

Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #4 - My parter was the best of the best! She was the master mind behind this project. She understood
					the concepts a lot better than I did. She was also able to explain to me in good detail how our 
					program was working. She also gave me some more insights on how to solve a programming challenge. 
					She was very willing yet again to let me give a change to take the reins. I really appreciated that.
					Over all I feel that she did the most work since she was able to solve most of our problems.

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership was good over all. I definitely would have wanted to solve more of our 
				issues, but that is okay. I believe that my ideas helped her solve some of the problems.
