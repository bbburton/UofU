Homework 7 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Lucas Idstrom
Date:    March 2, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 12 hours.

Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #4 - My parter was incredible. Extremely smart and a proficient programmer. He made programming
					look and seem easy. He knew his stuff and was able to put his thoughts into code very quickly.
					He also used his time extremely well. We finished coding on Wednesday night because of how 
					good he was.

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership went extremely well. We both worked together on the problems that
				we faced and both had some input. My only wish would be that I had more time to do the actual
				coding. He was just at another level of understand than I was. Therefore he did most of the coding.
				He though of solutions a lot faster than I did and could put those solution into code significantly 
				faster than me. What I learned from Lucas was how to look at a picture and analysis it so that you 
				can write the code. What he learned from me was organization. I was able to get the code organized
				and keep us focused and on task.
