Assignment #9 - Path Finder

Short Project Summary:

In assignment nine, we were to implement a breadth first search in order to help Pack Man find the shortest path 
in a given maze. To do this we had to input the maze through a file, run our breadth first search algorithm and 
convert our solution back into a file.

Notes to the TA: Thank you for your patients with me. I wish I was a more proficient programmer myself... Haha.

Design Decisions: Followed the instructions given to the best of our ability.

Problems Encountered and Their Solutions: 	We had problems with converting our solution to the maze back into a file.
