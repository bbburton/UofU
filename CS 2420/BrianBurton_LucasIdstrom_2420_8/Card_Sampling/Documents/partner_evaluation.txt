Homework 8 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Lucas Idstrom
Date:    March 24, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 12 hours.

Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #4 - My parter was incredible yet again. He is incredibly good at turning pseudocode into
					actual code. I learned from him that you need to understand the problem completely
					before you begin coding. If you do not do this then you often spend additional time 
					fixing your code to solve the actual problem once you find out what it actually is.
					I also learned from Lucas that there are many different ways to solve a problem. If 
					one does not work then try another one.

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership went pretty well. I wish we could have spent more time
				collaborating our ideas though. What happened most of the time was Lucas would read
				the instructions, understand them quickly, and then start on the solution. I on the 
				other hand had to think a lot longer about the problem and the goal of the code that
				we were to write. This made it hard for me to give any input. We did do a great job 
				of focusing on our tasks at hand though.
