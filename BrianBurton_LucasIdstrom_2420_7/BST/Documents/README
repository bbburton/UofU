Assignment #7 - BST

Binary Search Tree Project Summary:

In assignment seven, we were to implement a Binary Search Tree and then convert that to a sorted ArrayList. 
We then implemented the Spell Checker class. This class allowed us to see if words were spelled correctly
in a file. After this we implemented the timing code and compared our Binary Search Tree to Java's Tree.

Design Decisions: Followed the instructions given to the best of our ability.

Problems Encountered and Their Solutions: Had a hard time with the remove method. We also encountered a lot
											of null pointer exceptions.
