Homework 9 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Caleb Pope
Date:    March 31, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 12 hours.

Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #4 - My parter did an excelent job! He understood what we needed to do to get our program working corrently.
					He is very good at looking at the big picture. He is also very smart at changing pusedo code into code.
					Caleb was also very nice and was willing to explain any thing that I had a question on. I learned that
					you must first understand the pusedo code, write that down in your program, then follow you pusedo code
					to write the actual code. He learned from me that you can't just look at the big picture. You have to also
					notice all of the "small" details.

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership went well. Caleb handeled the "big" stuff while I worked on the "small" stuff.
				Caleb would work on converting pusedo code into code while I went through debuging the code that he was writing.
				He was able to get a lot of it correct, however there were a few bugs that I was able to catch that saved us a
				lot of time.
