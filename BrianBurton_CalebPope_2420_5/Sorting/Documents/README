Assignment #5 - Sorting

Short Project Summary:

In assignment five, we were to implament three sorting algorithms and then compare how long each of them took to
try and find the best sorting algorithm. 

Late Work: 	I have completed every part of this assignment except for my analisis document. The reason that I was unable to complete
			the assignment on time is because I only have a limited number of hours that I can work on this homework. It is also
			very hard for me to understand these concepts so it takes me longer. I plan to have my work done by Saturday if not sooner. 

Notes to the TA: Thank you for your patients with me. I wish I was a more proficient programmer myself... Haha.

Design Decisions: Follow the instructions given to the best of our ability.

Problems Encountered and Their Solutions: 	Could not get the Quick Sort Methods working correctly. They sorted the 
											arrays but would not give us correct time.
