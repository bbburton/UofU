My Name: Brian Burton
Partner: Caleb Pope
Date:    Feb 16, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 23 hours.

Make sure to also answer this question: "What did you learn from your partner? What did your partner learn from you?"

Partner Score: #4 - My parter did an increadible job yet again. He is a hard worker yet also knows how to have a little
					fun. He is very happy to explain things to me to help me understand what is going on. What I learned
					from him this time is how to better use helper methods, tests, and recursion. What my partner might
					have learned from me is persistance. I may not be the smartest as far as programming goes but I will
					work harder than everyone else in order to complete the assignments to the best of my ability. 

Group Analysis: I believe that our partnership worked out better this time then last. I believe that one of the reasons 
				for this is that we knew what to expect from each other. Last time we were unable to turn in our assignment
				because we were not done with our analysis. Therefore we planned ahead this time and worked on this assignment
				longer. We are still pushing it too close for comfort but I believe that we are closer to finishing on time
				than we were last time. I also like how we did a better job of evenly splitting the work load. He will let me 
				type my ideas and then he would correct any mistakes that I had made.
